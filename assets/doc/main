```

\#\#\# Cache Usage:
if you want to use the cache, you need to have [DoTheWorld](https://github.com/OUIsolutions/DoTheWorld/releases/download/v8.002/doTheWorld.h) downloaded and included in your project.
and you can configure the cache with the function **OpenAiInterface_set_cache**
 
```c
{darwin.dtw.load_file(path_examples .. "cache/main.c")}
```
